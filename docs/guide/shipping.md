# Shipping Information On Exported Products

As the product gets exported to the eBay end, the following shipping information also gets exported to eBay along with the product.

Some of the following details that get exported are mentioned below like:-

- Shipping & Handling charges,
- Shipping service,
- Custom shipping duration for minimum and maximum limits can be set in the number of days by the admin,
- Additional Shipping Amount if the customer purchases additional quantities.

#### **Product-Level eBay Shipping Cost**

When a product is imported from or exported to eBay, the module syncs the product-level shipping charge to the **eBay Shipping Details** attribute group on the Magento product edit form.

#### **eBay Product Shipping at Storefront**

Enable the carrier under **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Delivery Methods > eBay Product Shipping**. At checkout, shipping rates are calculated from each product's **eBay Shipping Cost** attribute.
