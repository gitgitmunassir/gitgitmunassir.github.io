# Application of Price Rule

**When Admin has set ‘*eBay Price Rule Applicable For*‘ Export Products-**

For instance, we have a price rule of increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30. On Magento end, we create a product with a price of $24 as below.

Then as we export this product to eBay the price will automatically be incremented to $26 as per the rule.

However, the same rule will act opposite if we import the same product from eBay to the Magento store.

***For example:*** If you have a product with $21 on eBay store and the price rule is set as of the increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30.

Now as we import the product to Magento store the price of the product at Magento end will be $19.

**When Admin has set ‘*eBay Price Rule Applicable For*‘ Import Products-**

Now the admin has the same price rule of increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30. The product is now on eBay at the price of $26 as given below.

Now, if the product gets imported the price of the product at the Magento store will be incremented by $2 as shown below.

Please notify here, the same rule will act opposite if we export the same product from eBay to Magento store.

For example, if you have a product with $26 and the price rule is set as of the increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30.

So as we import the product to eBay the price of the product at eBay end will be $24.
