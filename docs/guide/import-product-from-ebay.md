***Import Fields-***

- **End Date From** – Specifies the earliest (oldest) date to use in a date range filter based on item end time. Each of the time ranges must be a value less than 120 days.
- **End Date To** – Specifies the latest (most recent) date to use in a date range filter based on item end time. Must be specified if End Date From is specified.
- **SKUs (comma separated)** – Optional: enter one or more eBay SKUs separated by commas (e.g. `24-WB04,24-WB06`) to import only those listings. If left blank, products are imported using current pagination logic (all products).
- **Import Only eBay Active Products** – When checked, only actively listed eBay products are imported.

Hence, click the **Import Product From eBay** button as visible in the screenshot above.

#### Bulk Migrate Listing

From the **Sync From eBay** dropdown, select **Migrate Listing By ID** to migrate specific eBay listings into the Inventory API using their listing IDs.

***Fields-***

- **Listing ID(s)** – Enter one listing ID or up to 5 comma-separated listing IDs per request.
- **Migrate** – Submits the bulk migration request to eBay via the Sell Inventory API. A confirmation message displays the status for each listing ID after processing.

**Note:** Bulk migrate is useful when you need to import or migrate specific eBay listings by ID rather than using the date-range or SKU-based import in step 1.
