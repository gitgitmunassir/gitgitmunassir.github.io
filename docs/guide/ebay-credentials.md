# How to get eBay Connector credentials?

After the successful installation of Magento 2 ebay integration module, one will need to fill in the eBay developer keys **(app id, cert id, dev id, user id, auth token**).

Thus, the eBay account has these credentials.

However, if the user doesn’t have an account, then the user will have to create an account and get the required keys.

#### **First Step**

To create a new account go to [**developer.ebay.com**](https://developer.ebay.com) and click on the **sign-in/Join link**.

#### Third Step

After the above step, you need to create an app. Enter the **app name** and choose the **environment** to generate your **key set**.

So, keep a note that when you generate the keys set then only the app saves.
