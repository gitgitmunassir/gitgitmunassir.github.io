# Map order

Before synchronizing the orders from eBay to Magento 2, make sure that all products and its categories are synchronized from the eBay store to Magento 2 store.

**1. Import Order from eBay**

The admin can import the orders from the eBay store.

Here, the admin will click on “Import Order from eBay” tab, an eBay Order Range page will open as per the below image.

The admin will enter the date range. Proceed by clicking on **Import Order from eBay** and then orders will be imported from eBay to Magento 2 store.

So, only those orders will be imported from **eBay **to ** Magento 2 **whose status is “**Complete”** on eBay.

Thus, if the eBay Product is not synced with Magento 2 store then the system will show an error.

**2. Run eBay Order Profiler**

Now, the admin will click on **Run eBay Order Profiler** and orders from eBay will be imported and admin can see how much orders are imported and how many orders are left.

Hence the admin can get an error message if the eBay Order id is already mapped with Magento 2 Order id before running the profiler.

So, post importing the orders from eBay to Magento 2 store, the grid will look as per the below image.

**Note –**

- A cron is set which automatically imports the orders from the eBay store to Magento 2 store.  So, it also imports the products in the order, if they aren’t imported earlier.
- For the imported orders when the admin process the shipments in Magento, tracking information is automatically synchronized to the corresponding eBay order in real-time. However, vice versa is not possible.
